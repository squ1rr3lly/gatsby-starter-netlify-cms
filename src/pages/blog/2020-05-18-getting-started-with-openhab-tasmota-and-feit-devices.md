title: Getting Started with OpenHAB, Tasmota, and Feit Devices
date: 2020-05-18T02:24:35.118Z
description: This is my experience building a home-wide network of smart
  lights/switches/outlets using only open-source software and inexpensive (but
  reliable) hardware. It integrates with most common smart home and smart
  assistant devices, and it's easily possible to do every light in a small home
  for $300-$400 dollars or just a room for $50 or less. I used a Raspberry Pi as
  the server (but any old system would do), OpenHAB as the smart controller,
  Feit brand smart things (cheap at Costco or online), and Tasmota firmware.
